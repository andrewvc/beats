== Community Dashboards

The open source community has been hard at work developing new Dashboards. You can check
out some of them here. For information on exporting and importing dashboards see the documentation for
{kibana-ref}/managing-saved-objects.html[Kibana Saved Objects].

Have a question about a community dashboard? You can post questions and discuss issues in the
https://discuss.elastic.co/c/beats/community-dashboards[Community Dashboards] category of the Beats discussion forum.

Have you created a dashboard that's not listed? Add the name, description, and link to the homepage of your dashboard
to the source document for https://github.com/elastic/beats/blob/master/libbeat/docs/communitydashboards.asciidoc[Community Dashboards]
and https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests[open a pull request] in the https://github.com/elastic/beats[Beats GitHub repository]
to get your change merged. When you're ready, go ahead and https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements[announce]
your new dashboard in the Elastic discussion forum.
